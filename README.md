reallyenglish-authpf-proxypac
=============================

proxy.pac for authpf users.

The problem
===========

when authpf user is using internal proxy, the proxy doesn't allow access to
URLs not listed in pre-defined ACL. That means they cannot browse external and
internal sites at the same time.

Usage
=====

Set the URL to the proxy.pac in browser's "automatic proxy configuration"
setting.
